 <h1>Counter App</h1>

A simple React counter app that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter with real-time updates displayed in a 'div'.

- Increment: Increases the counter by 1.
- Decrement: Decreases the counter by 1.
- Reset: Resets the counter back to 0.

The app uses React's `useState` hook for state management and `useRef` to directly manipulate the DOM for displaying messages when the counter is updated.

##  Features

- Reset the counter to 0.
- Real-time feedback shown when the counter is updated.
